  Commentary 01: Born in the USSR: 28 Up
</h2>
<section>
    <ol>
      <li>Brief 
        <ul>In this article, I discuss the heaviness and despair found in the Russian film, whihc mirroring the historical challenges faced by Slavic nations, particularly those born in the 1980s who witnessed the collapse. It explores the hunger for food and the lasting impact of scarcity on Russian people, as well as the sense of displacement and the search for belonging experienced by someone who moved to the United States to escape their homeland.

<section>
<ol>
  <li>Brief 
    <ul>Slezkine's study uses the "commune apartment" metaphor to analyze Soviet pluralism, revealing differences in nations' roles and modernization within the Russian Empire. This article highlights the contrast between Soviet cultural diversity and the Chinese government's treatment of Uyghurs, which diverges from traditional Chinese pluralism.

<section>
  <ol>
    <li>Brief
      <ul>The article by Shoshan explores how young extreme rightists in Germany construct their political identity rooted in the multi-ethnic urban experience. Accordingly, my study discusses the challenges faced by the Vietnamese community in Germany, leading to the formation of distinct North and South Vietnamese communities due to differing historical contexts and settlement conditions.

    <li>Brief
      <ul>The article explores the resurgence of xenophobia in Europe, particularly in Hungary, and its impact on overseas Chinese immigrants living in Europe. Despite personal interests between China and Eastern European politicians and businesspeople, overseas Chinese in Europe face challenges in adaptation and integration due to the hidden nature of xenophobia.

<section>
 <ol>
    <li>Brief
      <ul> (Inspires my capstone ‚ù§Ô∏è) This article challenges the perception of nostalgia as mere sentimentality, delving into its multifaceted role. I explore how post-communist nostalgia serves as a tool for Bulgaristan migrants in Turkey to manage their reception. While exploring the enduring appeal of post-Soviet aesthetics in a globalized world, the article cautions against superficial fetishization, emphasizing the importance of distinguishing between nostalgia and the romanticization of a dictatorial regime.

<section>
 <ol>
    <li>Brief
      <ul> Nadkarni's article examines the controversies surrounding Hungary's House of Terror, which attempts to commemorate both socialism and fascism in the same frame, reflecting Hungary's struggle to reinvent itself post-socialism. And I explores the emergence of socialist heritage as an economic sector after the Soviet Union's dissolution, examining tourist motivations in Eastern and Western Europe, particularly in China. Lastly, I question the ongoing relevance of terms like "socialism" and "post-socialism" 31 years after the Collapse of the Soviet Union.

<section>
 <ol>
    <li>Brief
      <ul>In this article, I discuss Russia and China's efforts to contest the international order, emphasizing their resistance to liberal pressures and the adoption of illiberalism to establish new norms. It compares Russia's rejection of the liberal world order under Putin to Orb√°n's vision of illiberal democracy in Hungary. Additionally, it highlights China's unique path, maintaining an oppressive political system while achieving economic growth through market reforms and a one-party meritocracy, posing a challenge to liberal democracies.

      <ul> Within this article, I discuss the changing nature of geopolitical strategies in the twenty-first century, emphasizing the importance of understanding a people's identity for claims to sovereignty. It draws parallels between Russia's hidden interventions and China's aggressive tactics toward Taiwan and erosion of democracy in Hong Kong.

<ol>
    <li>Brief
      <ul>This article discusses the emergence of "Gopnik" culture at the turn of the 21st century and its evolution from Russian street gangs in 1992. This subculture is deeply rooted in Russian identity and has influenced social class, masculinity, and had an international impact in a rapidly changing world. I also explores how Gosha Rubchinskiy integrated Gopnik aesthetics into popular culture, transforming Gopniks from a marginalized group in Russian society into a globally recognized aesthetic.
